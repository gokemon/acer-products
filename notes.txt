I am 49 Days into my 100 Days of Code. And I am taking a break!
Rather than not post a commit, which would look like I wasn't present, or I missed it, 
I am choosing to post a note. I may post actual code later, if I feel like it.

I added Bootstrap 4/next, but now I need to remove the old bootstrap, 
and fix any migration issues. Just added some images.



This is my take on a Product Management page.
Nested components like the stars 
and a welcome page, and a product and product details page add to routing realism. 

This project is based on angular-2-getting-started on pluralsight


Turns out there is a fatal flaw in my project. I never quite knew how it got started, but I was just building and building...
It doesn't have the Angular CLI as core of this project, so I plan to restart it.

I also plan to use the AdventureWorks as part of the database.
