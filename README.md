# acer-products
Acer Products is a sample company website in Angular 2, as my showcase.


## Starting Instructions ##
1) Open a command prompt in the project's root directory (APM)

2) Type: `npm install`
    This installs the dependencies as defined in the package.json file.
    
3) Type: `npm start`
    This launches the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile the application and wait for changes. 
    It also starts the lite-server and launches the browser to run the application.


## Design Considerations ##
What shall I work through?
